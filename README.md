courtfinder
===========
A small mobile app based on meteorite. The app is called courtfinder. On courtfinder you can select places to checkin in.
The idea behind is to see how many people are playing on a courtyard. Because playing basekball alone doesnt make any fun.
This app was a project in mobile networks in university.

This app is quite old and based on meteorite version 0.5.1.
